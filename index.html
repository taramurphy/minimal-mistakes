I am an Associate Professor and ARC Future Fellow at the University of Sydney.
My research is in radio transients, and I co-lead the transients projects on 
two major SKA pathfinders, the Murchison Widefield Array and the Australian 
SKA Pathfinder.

I teach computational science and data science for physics and astronomy
students, and I'm particularly interested in online teaching and teaching
innovation. 

With my other hat on I run an edtech business, [Grok Learning](https://groklearning.com), that provides
coding courses for high schools and universities.

You can find me in Room 365 in the School of Physics, but email is the best
way of getting in touch.
