to set up a STEM program for high school students.

In 2017 we launched 
the [first ICT and coding courses available in Khmer](https://groklearning.com/ictangkor/), 
based on the Australian curriculum. Read more about [preparing young Khmer for life in the digital age](https://blog.groklearning.com/preparing-young-khmer-for-life-in-the-digital-age-6b336d94df4a).


### Coding in school
Programming and computational thinking are critical skills for today's students. Some of the projects I'm involved in to help improve these skills for both students and teachers are:
* The [Australian Computing Academy](https://aca.edu.au/)
* The [National Computer Science School Challenge](http://sydney.edu.au/wpo/high-schools/stage5/national-computer-science-school-challenge.shtml/)
