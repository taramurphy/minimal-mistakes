## Radio monitoring of gravitational wave events
The detection of gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation from a 
neutron star merger was a scientific breakthrough, with important 
implications for physics and astronomy. We are using three Australian radio 
telescopes to search for and monitor radio waves from future gravitational 
wave events. These observations will provide key information to unlock the 
mystery of what causes some of the most energetic events in the Universe, 
their environment and how they evolve. 

Some of our recent papers are:
* [Dobie et al.](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180306853D) A turnover in the radio light curve of GW170817
* [Mooley et al.](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018Natur.554..207M) A mildly relativistic wide-angle outflow in the neutron-star merger event GW170817
* [Hallinan et al.](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Sci...358.1579H) A radio counterpart to a neutron star merger
* [Kasliwal et al.](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Sci...358.1559K) Illuminating gravitational waves: A concordant picture of photons from a neutron star merger
